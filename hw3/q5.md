1. Download https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip. Don't download it if it's already downloaded
2. Iterate over all zip files but read only md and mdx ones
3. Remove the first part of the path in the filename. So "fastmcp-main/docs/getting-started/welcome.mdx" becomes "docs/getting-started/welcome.mdx"
4. Index these files with minsearch. Put the text content in "content" field and filename in "filename"
5. Use https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/minsearch to learn how to use minsearch
6. Create a search function that retrieves 5 most relevant documents from the index
7. Create search.py and test the implementation there
8. What's the first file returned that you get with the query "demo"?
